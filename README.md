# SSH login brute forcing

This project illustrates the process of brute-forcing SSH login credentials using Pythonâ€™s pwntools and paramiko libraries. The objective is to automate the process of attempting various passwords from a wordlist to access an SSH server. The script loads passwords from a file, tries each one for login, and identifies the correct password by handling exceptions caused by failed authentication attempts.

This project replicates a common security testing scenario, where penetration testers perform brute-force attacks to evaluate the strength of system authentication. It offers a practical learning experience in understanding how brute-force attacks are carried out and highlights how systems can be vulnerable to such attacks when robust password policies are not implemented.

To enable SSH on a Kali Linux machine, run the following commands:

Start the SSH service with sudo systemctl start ssh.
Check the status of the service using sudo systemctl status ssh.
Verify SSH is listening on port 22 by running sudo netstat -tuln | grep :22.
These steps ensure that SSH is running and accessible on the local machine.

Project Overview

1 create a script 
to find top 10000 password you can download here https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials
2 enable ssh on a local host 
3 run script 
4 once our script identify valid password it stops and show as 
5 here is an example of using existing python modules - pwn and paramiko to perform common hacking task of brute forcing
